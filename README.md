## 📌 About This Repository

This repository provides **comprehensive solutions** for the 20 Docker tasks across four levels of the **KodeKloud Engineer Docker** challenge. The tasks documented here reflect the specific challenges I encountered during the challenge, including detailed solutions and verification steps for foundational, intermediate, advanced, and enterprise-level Docker scenarios. **Note**: While the core objectives and challenges remain consistent, specific values (e.g., server names, file paths, or ports) in these tasks may differ in your environment. However, the underlying concepts and problem-solving approaches are universally applicable, enabling you to adapt the solutions to your context. Each solution is crafted for DevOps engineers, combining best practices, detailed documentation, and real-world expertise to accelerate mastery of Docker containerization.

**🎯 Mission**: Empower DevOps professionals to master Docker through practical, production-ready solutions for container management, networking, and orchestration.

**⏱️ Timeline**: This project covers 20 tasks across four levels, with Level 4 focusing on advanced enterprise scenarios.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue 1: Docker Service Not Running**
**Symptoms**: `docker ps` fails with "Cannot connect to Docker daemon".
**Solution**: Verify Docker service status and start it.
```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### **Issue 2: Permission Denied**
**Symptoms**: Non-root user cannot execute Docker commands.
**Solution**: Add user to Docker group.
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### **Issue 3: Image Pull Failure**
**Symptoms**: `docker pull` fails due to network or registry issues.
**Solution**: Check network connectivity and registry status.
```bash
ping registry-1.docker.io
docker pull nginx:latest
```

### **Issue 4: Container Port Conflict**
**Symptoms**: `docker run` fails with "port is already allocated".
**Solution**: Identify and free conflicting ports.
```bash
sudo netstat -tuln | grep :80
sudo kill <pid>
```

### **Issue 5: Dockerfile Build Failure**
**Symptoms**: `docker build` fails due to file path errors.
**Solution**: Verify file paths in `COPY` commands relative to the build context.
```bash
ls -la /opt/docker
cat Dockerfile
```

### **Issue 6: Compose File Errors**
**Symptoms**: `docker compose up` fails due to syntax or dependency issues.
**Solution**: Validate the YAML file and correct service references.
```bash
docker compose config
vi docker-compose.yml
```

## ⚠️ Important Production Notes

🔧 **Container Deployment**: Solutions deploy production-ready Docker containers and services.

🔐 **Security Compliance**: Configurations follow non-root execution, secure file transfers (e.g., `scp`), and least privilege principles.

📊 **Resource Management**: Commands optimized for efficient CPU, memory, and storage usage.

🛡️ **Scalability**: Configurations support multi-container orchestration and scaling.

🚀 **Enterprise Readiness**: Level 4 solutions address complex debugging, multi-container stacks, and application-specific Dockerization (Node.js, Python) for enterprise environments.
